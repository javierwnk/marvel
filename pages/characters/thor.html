                <h2>Thor Odinson Profile</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <h3>Name: Thor Odinson, also known by his title the God of Thunder</h3>

                <p><strong>Portrayed by:</strong> Chris Hemsworth</p>
                <p><strong>First Appearance:</strong> Thor (2011)</p>
                <p><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Asgard, Avengers</p>
                <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> God of Thunder, King of Asgard (formerly), Protector of Earth</p>

                <h3>Powers:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Superhuman Strength and Durability:</strong> Possesses immense physical strength and
                        durability, far exceeding that of any human.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stamina and Regeneration:</strong> Boasts superhuman stamina and regenerative abilities,
                        allowing him to recover quickly from injuries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mastery of Lightning:</strong> Can summon and manipulate lightning at will, channeling
                        it through his body or Mjolnir, his enchanted hammer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flight:</strong> Able to fly at immense speeds, primarily through the power of Mjolnir.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Weather Manipulation:</strong> Can influence and control the weather to a certain
                        extent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> As an Asgardian, Thor possesses a greatly extended lifespan.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Weaknesses:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vulnerability to Specific Weapons:</strong> Though incredibly durable, Thor is
                        susceptible to certain enchanted weapons, particularly those made of Uru metal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Over-reliance on Mjolnir:</strong> Initially, Thor's power was heavily reliant upon
                        Mjolnir. However, he has since learned to tap into his own inherent abilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Arrogance and Impulsiveness:</strong> When young, Thor displayed arrogance and
                        impulsiveness, leading to reckless decisions and conflict. He has matured significantly over
                        time.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>The Norse God of Thunder, son of Odin and Frigga, brother of Loki and Hela, and the heir to the
                    Asgardian throne. Naturally as the son of Odin, he possesses Super-Toughness and Super-Strength much
                    higher than the Asgardian norm. On top of that, he carries Mj√∂lnir, the mythical hammer that only
                    those deemed worthy may wield (or even lift), which grants him the powers of flight, storm-based
                    Weather Manipulation, energy projection, and whatever else is convenient.</p>
                <p>To teach his son humility after Thor nearly reignites a war with another world, Odin exiled Thor to
                    Earth, where the Asgardian met and began an on-again-off-again relationship with a scientist named
                    Jane Foster. While Thor's visit to Earth helped teach him to rein in his more questionable impulses,
                    he continues to be a bit of a Blood Knight and Glory Seeker, seeing his work protecting the Nine
                    Realms and fighting with the Avengers as grand adventures.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, this boisterous attitude is harshly tested as the threats against him and his allies
                    grow, culminating in a Trauma Conga Line that ends in the destruction of Asgard and the
                    near-extinction of his people. Driven by vengeance, he seeks a way to destroy Thanos and his armies
                    to avenge his race... and rather unsure what to do with himself in the aftermath.</p>
